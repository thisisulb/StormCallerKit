## StormCallerKit v1.1
## for BGEE / BG2EE / EET

Unlike other shamans the Storm Caller focuses <PRO_HISHER> attention on harnessing and mastering the powers of the storm. With their ability to conjure up terrible storms and call down lightning on their opponents these shamans make powerful foes and allies even though they are less versed in the ways of the spirit world than others of their kind.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Storm Callers can summon lightning storms from the elemental plane of air by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Storm Caller dances, opponents within a 30' radius have a 12% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman to be struck by lightning, up to a maximum of 50% at level 20. The lightning strikes become more powerful as the Shaman gains additional levels:  
  Level 1: 2d6 electrical damage  
  Level 6: 4d6 electrical damage   
  Level 12: 6d6 electrical damage  
  Level 18: 8d6 electrical damage  
  Level 24: 10d6 electrical damage  
  
– Gains 'Storm Aura' as a special ability at level 12.  
  
STORM AURA: Once a Storm Caller has become powerful enough <PRO_HESHE> can conjure up a small storm on the spirit plane which follows <PRO_HIMHER> around and occasionally strikes out against the Shaman's opponents on the material plane. While Storm Aura is active opponents within a 30' radius have a 5% chance each round to be struck by lightning and take 10d6 electrical damage.
